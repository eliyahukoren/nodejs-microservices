Ingress v1 API Required Update
When running kubectl apply in the upcoming lecture, you may encounter a warning or error about the v1beta1 API version that is being used.

The v1 Ingress API is now required as of Kubernetes v1.22 and the v1beta1 will no longer work.

Only a few very minor changes are needed:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/

Notably, a pathType needs to be added, and how we specify the backend service name and port has changed:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-srv
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
    - host: posts.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /posts
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: posts-clusterip-srv
                port:
                  number: 4000
The zip resources attached to each lecture will contain the updated v1 API Ingress code if you need it.
